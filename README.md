# Fragify Game Templates

This is a repository holding most of the games, bots, or tools offered with our custom version of [Pterodactyl][Pterodactyl] which we call [Fragify][Fragify].

Any push to this repository will trigger a new build on our [Quay repository][quay] holding the docker images required to run your instances! 

A lot of the templates were written by [Parkervcp][parker] and the [Pterodactyl][Pterodactyl] community!
